Sandblasting signs is done by forcibly propelling a high-pressure stream of abrasive material to clean, etch, or carve a surface. In the signs industry, it is used to cleanly remove specific sections of a sign in order to achieve a smooth, even dimensional effect. With a high-pressure jet of sand and air, an ordinary panel is transformed into impactful signage that tastefully represents a brand and its personality."
