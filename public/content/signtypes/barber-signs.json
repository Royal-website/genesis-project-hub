      "text": "Barber signs take a lot of knowledge and experience to produce effectively, because they involve the challenging task of making them look alike and different at the same time. Whenever one sees a helix of red, blue, and white stripes, they almost automatically associate it with a barber shop…these stripes are the trademark, practically the uniform, of barber signs. However, barber shops also have their own unique identity that sets them apart from the rest."

Royal Signs & Awnings has been in the sign-making business for many years now and has mastered the art and science of creating barber signs."

LED signs by Royal Signs & Awnings are also highly customizable and can be made to display your choice of text, images, figures, and even videos."

Plus, they put your glass windows to great use. Flag signs and teardrop signs are excellent options for promoting special events. And for off-site events such as trade shows, expos, or charity work, pull-up banners and sandwich signs make great tools because they’re lightness, easy transport, and convenience."
