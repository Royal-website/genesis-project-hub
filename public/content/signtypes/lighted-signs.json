Modern technology introduces LED lighted signs with the appearance of a neon sign, but with a longer lifespan and much less expensive maintenance costs. If you want the classic feel of a neon sign, but aren’t excited about the expense, we are the right partner. Give us a call, tell us what you want, and we will make it happen for you!"

      "text": "LED lighting has many different signage applications, beyond the look of classic neon. Channel letters and cabinet signs can both benefit from backlighting. Lighted signs will light up your business in the dark, and are especially useful for late-night businesses, such as convenience stores, gas stations, nightclubs, restaurants, hotels, and theaters. Our LED signs are custom made to fit your desires, and are available in a wide variety of color, style, and animation options."

Beyond that, there are many ways you can use them to promote any aspect of your business. For example, a restaurant may want to provide a smooth customer flow, and may choose to highlight order and pickup stations using lighted signs. These signs can be completely custom created to suit your needs and imagination. Our staff of skilled sign designers are ready to turn your ideas into reality."
