      "text": "Not all acrylic signs are created equal. Though they serve a variety of purposes and can be fabricated for different types of uses, it’s important to get them made in a way that enhances its effectivity and increases its lifespan. One way to do this is to determine how you want your design to be printed on your particular acrylic sign: standard surface or subsurface printing. And Royal Signs & Awnings has the skill and equipment to do both."

    {
      "tag": "P",
      "text": "Standard surface printing means Royal Signs & Awnings prints your design on the front side of the acrylic. This gives your sign a matte finish and a thicker feel. If you aren’t exactly fond of having transparent signs and would prefer to have the design cover up the space on the sign, then standard surface acrylic signs would be a good option for you."

    {

      "text": "Subsurface surface or second surface printing means we print your design on the back side of the clear piece of acrylic. Royal Signs & Awnings prints the design in reverse so that it can be seen through the front. Subsurface acrylic signs have a glossy finish and a feel of depth. Though they cost more than standard surface signs, having your design printed under the layer of acrylic does give your sign more protection from elements and makes it last longer in the outdoors. If you’re looking for signs that comes with a glass-framed appearance and a layer of protection for your design, subsurface acrylic signs will do the trick."
