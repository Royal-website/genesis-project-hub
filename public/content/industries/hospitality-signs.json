The US hotel industry alone reached revenue of 208 billion USD in 2017…and hotel or lodging is just one of the four sectors under the hospitality industry. The other sectors—food and beverage, recreation, and travel and tourism—are looking at a lot of money in revenue as well. It relies on the consumers’ disposable income, and because customers are paying for the experience that they get, customer satisfaction is a key defining feature in the hospitality industry."
