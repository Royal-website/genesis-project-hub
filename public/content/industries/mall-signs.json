Despite these challenges and the fact that they rely a lot on retail businesses, many malls continue to grow and thrive. How is this possible? Well, they’ve adapted to the changes by using their space to increase foot traffic. And mall signs play a key role in making all that happen."

If you’re looking for something for the long-term, metal, aluminum, alumalite, and PVC are ideal choices because of their durability. For signs with a more temporary nature, vinyl, acrylic, and coroplast will do the trick without breaking the bank."
