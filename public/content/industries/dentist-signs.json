      "text": "Dental appointments aren’t exactly the most relaxing and stress-free of meetings, which is why dentists are doing their best to make every patient’s visit as calming and hassle-free as possible. One inexpensive way to help in this effort is by setting up dentist signs that are not only aesthetically pleasing, but also convey important information to your patients. This way, when patients look around your clinic lobby, they are visually and mentally preoccupied and can take their mind off their nerves."

      "text": "When it comes to increasing patient footfall in your dental practice, the challenge isn’t really in convincing people to step in your clinic…because if the person doesn’t need to see a dentist, he just won’t do that no matter how hard you try to convince him. However, if a person is looking for a dentist to address their concern, they are highly likely to step inside your clinic if they know that you’re offering the services that they need. And the challenge is in letting people know that your clinic exists, that it’s open, and that you can help them."
