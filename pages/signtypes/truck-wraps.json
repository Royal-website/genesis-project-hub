The majority of people travel the same way to work every single day, meaning that you are passing the same people every single day, whether you realize it or not. If they were carrying a giant sign, you would probably remember the guy on the corner who always has a giant sign. The same is true for your vehicle. Your wrap turns your vehicle into a highly recognizable and memorable work of custom art that attracts attention and reinforces your message every time they see it."
