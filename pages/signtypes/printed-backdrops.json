Over the years, ideas and innovation have taken sign design, sign substrates, printing processes, installation techniques to a whole new level. And each breakthrough brings business owners closer to bigger signs with better quality and faster turnaround times."

All they have to do is tap a reliable local sign company who can print them the exact backdrops they want instead."

The best thing about our backdrops is that they’re custom-made to fit your unique brand, event, target market, and objectives."

      "text": "If you’re looking at backdrops for an indoor event, a fabric substrate is a great choice. The thicker ones such as heavy knit fabrics and cotton canvas are good options if your backdrop is meant to be front-lit. Translucent and medium-weight substrates, on the other hand, go well with backlighting."

Royal Signs & Awnings offers vinyl mesh perfect for windy occasions, or the regular matte vinyl prints. Paired with premium, fade-resistant eco-solvent ink, we’re confident that your outdoor backdrops will look good for a long time."

They are also reinforced with premium nylon to ensure extra strength along the hems and the grommets. We are committed to making your backdrop banners look crisp and clean for a long time. Custom printed backdrops by Royal Signs & Awnings are perfect for events, concerts, and trade shows that involve traveling to different places with different weather conditions."

With the advent of large format printing and PVC banner substrates, you won’t have to deal with all that hassle."

When it comes to transporting, they are simply rolled, shipped, and then unrolled—no need for steaming or ironing before setup. Installation is hassle-free as well. Our printed backdrops are equipped with strong hems and can have eyelets/grommets or pole pockets, depending on your preference."
