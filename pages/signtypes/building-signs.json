Channel letters and dimensional letters can include individual letters and numbers, even shapes and logos. These are an extremely popular choice for many different business types, from retail stores to manufacturing facilities because of their durable design and level of customization. Channel letters allow light to be housed within them as they typically have a transparent face, while dimensional letters are typically cut from a single sheet of metal or acrylic, and can be backlit to attract more attention."

Channel letter signs are commonly backlit, and cabinet signs almost always include a lighted element inside. Ideal for places that are open late, such as retail stores, bars, gas stations, convenience stores, and theaters, lighted signs truly help your business increase your visibility in the best possible way."

These signs can be backlit cabinet signs, or may be made of custom materials such as High Density Urethane Foam, wood, or metal. These are great for stopping foot traffic, and are often used in conjunction with storefront signage , or as a directional sign for a business that may be located within the building but without a storefront, such as a private investigators office located above a bookstore."

Awning signs are most commonly constructed of a stretched canvas material, however they can be constructed of any type of fabric or metal, depending on your desires and specifications. We recommend products that are resistant to weathering, allowing you maximum lifespan for your building signage. Awning signs are fantastic for places that want to provide a boutique-like feel, or have a necessity to provide a canopy, such as a hotel or open-air restaurant."
