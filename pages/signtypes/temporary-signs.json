They can usually be removed without special handling. They are used to promote, advertise, announce, or identify a business or event for a limited period of time."

For many businesses, this means having the signs generate as much impression as possible in that short span of time and, eventually, converting those impressions to income. And Royal Signs & Awnings can help you with that."
