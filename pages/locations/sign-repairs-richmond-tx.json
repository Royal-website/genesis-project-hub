High winds, flying debris, and heavy rain can cause significant damage to outdoor signage, ranging from minor scratches to complete destruction. Prompt repair is crucial to maintain a professional appearance and avoid potential safety hazards. Business owners should first assess the extent of the damage, then contact a professional sign company for repairs or replacement. In some cases, temporary signage may be necessary while waiting for permanent repairs. It’s also wise to review insurance policies to determine coverage for storm-related sign damage."
