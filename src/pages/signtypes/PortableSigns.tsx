          Portable signs are signs that are not permanently attached to the ground or any structure. Such signs include A-frames, chalkboard and whiteboard signs, flag signs, banners, yard signs, etc. They have been useful tools in advertising for more than a century and are still considered a worthwhile investment until now.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A reason why portable signs remain to be a relevant and popular sign choice for businesses is that they help generate income through their highly effective promotional function. The best part? They come at a reasonable price and can even be rented out to other businesses and bring in even more money. Portable signages are used to attract and capture the attention of passersby and pointing them to a specific business, ultimately helping convert curious pedestrians to potential customers.

          Royal Signs & Awnings also offers portable signs fit to catch attention and promote brands in smaller areas such as sidewalks. Our sandwich sign options put the "portable" in portable signs. They are small, light, and compact enough to move around and store easily, but are also durable enough to withstand everyday outdoor elements.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A-frame signs by Royal Signs & Awnings also offer some flexibility. Some models are made with high-quality hard plastic and can be kept in place more firmly by filling up the frames with sand or water. When you're done using the sign, you can simply pour the sand or water out and proceed to storage.
        </p>

          At Royal Signs & Awnings, we have a wide selection of portable signs that you can choose from. We want to give you the signage that best suits your business…whether it's something as light as a pop-up A-frame sign made of water-repellant fabric, or something as heavy-duty as steel-framed marquee sign with ballasts.

          Portable signs are subject to quite a list of requirements, guidelines, codes, and restrictions depending on where you are located. Making sure that your business keeps up with the government's specific standards can be a challenge that other sign providers aren't ready to take. But we are.

          At Royal Signs & Awnings, we protect our clients from possible noncompliance and violations by staying informed of the bylaws and manufacturing custom portable signs that meet them. We can also offer you our knowledge and advice as you secure permits and submit requirements.
