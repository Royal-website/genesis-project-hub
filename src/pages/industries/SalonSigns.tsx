You also need custom-crafted salon signs to accurately capture your uniqueness and showcase it to your target market. Generic, store-bought signage just can't do that for you.

            Neon signs are one of those signs that many people expect to see in a salon. Unfortunately, neon signs are slowly being phased out and in some states is prohibited because of a couple of reasons including maintenance costs, safety issues, and fragility. The good news, though, is that technology has brought us a safer, more affordable, and more durable, alternative to neon signs…LED signs!

          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
            If your salon's branding is just craving for a splash of neon light, LED signs by Royal Signs & Awnings can be a great solution.

They are perfect for outdoor signage and can serve as 24/7 advertising tools for your salon.
          </p>
