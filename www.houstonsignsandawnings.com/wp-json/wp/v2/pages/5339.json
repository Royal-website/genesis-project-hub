High winds, flying debris, and heavy rain can cause significant damage to outdoor signage, ranging from minor scratches to complete destruction. Prompt repair is crucial to maintain a professional appearance and avoid potential safety hazards. Business owners should first assess the extent of the damage, then contact a professional sign company for repairs or replacement. In some cases, temporary signage may be necessary while waiting for permanent repairs. It&#8217;s also wise to review insurance policies to determine coverage for storm-related sign damage.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Neon sign repair? LED sign repair?
