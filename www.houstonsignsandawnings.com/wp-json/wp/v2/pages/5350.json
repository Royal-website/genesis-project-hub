Here are some expert tips to help you make the right choice:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Consider viewing distance: The size of your sign should be proportional to the distance from which it will typically be viewed. This often means going big to ensure readability from afar for high-rise signs.<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright wp-image-5364 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.houstonsignsandawnings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/HighRise-Signs-12-300x229.jpg\"  alt=\"Houston High-Rise Signs HighRise Signs 12 300x229\"  width=\"300\" height=\"229\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.houstonsignsandawnings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/HighRise-Signs-12-300x229.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.houstonsignsandawnings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/HighRise-Signs-12.jpg 315w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Analyze surrounding buildings: Consider the height and proximity of neighboring structures to determine the optimal placement for maximum visibility.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Understand local regulations: Familiarize yourself with Houston&#8217;s signage ordinances to ensure your high-rise sign complies with size and placement restrictions.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Balance aesthetics and functionality: Your sign should complement your building&#8217;s architecture and be easily readable and recognizable.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Leverage natural sightlines: Position your sign where it can be seen from major roads, highways, or other high-traffic areas.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Account for lighting conditions: Consider how sunlight and shadows may affect your sign&#8217;s visibility throughout the day, and choose a placement that maximizes visibility in various lighting conditions.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Think about future growth: If you plan to expand your business or rebrand, choose a size and placement that can accommodate potential changes.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">By considering these factors, you&#8217;ll be well on your way to creating a high-rise sign that effectively promotes your brand and stands out in the Houston skyline.
