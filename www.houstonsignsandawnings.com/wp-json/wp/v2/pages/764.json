Truck and car vinyl graphics are cut into the shape of the image you want and adhered to the vehicle, so while they look professional they are not entirely flush with the side of the vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>Usually a cut piece of vinyl allows for flexibility in design and makes it easier to move or update the design with changes in your phone number, logo, or business name.<\/p>\n<p>If you prefer a simple logo and phone number on your business vehicle or fleet, often a vinyl graphic is the best option.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Vehicle Magnets<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright wp-image-2972 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.houstonsignsandawnings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Car-vehicle-Magnet-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"car magnet\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.houstonsignsandawnings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Car-vehicle-Magnet-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.houstonsignsandawnings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Car-vehicle-Magnet.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Do you use your personal vehicle for work?
