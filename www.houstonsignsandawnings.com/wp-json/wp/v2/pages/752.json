Canopy is a sun-shading device or overhang that is mostly designed to give protection to people from the sun. An awning can be in the form of a roof or window. In a way, awning also controls the amount of sunlight that streams in, but it also prevents rainwater from splashing in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These are the remarkable attributes of canopy and awning architecture-wise, but did you know that you can also use it for the benefit of your business? Definitely yes! Getting canopy or awning signs for your business allows you to post your brand like a billboard that can be visible even to taller buildings. Typically, an awning sign can be created out of a stretched canvas that acts as an overhang to your building\u2019s main entrance or large windows. It can include the business name and other important details as well, especially your persuasive branding message.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Monument Signs<\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright wp-image-2288 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.houstonsignsandawnings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Monument-Foam-300x183.jpg\" alt=\"custom foam monument sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"183\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.houstonsignsandawnings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Monument-Foam-300x183.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.houstonsignsandawnings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Monument-Foam-768x470.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.houstonsignsandawnings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Monument-Foam.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.houstonsignsandawnings.com\/monument-signs\/\">Monument signs<\/a> are totally monumental!
